# **Calculating Possible 5-Card Poker Hands**

<br />
Subtitle: <br />
We can calculate the total number of possible 5 card draw hands in a standard
deck of 52 cards with the combination formula.

<br />
<CombinationFormula />
<br />

Where: <br/>
n = total number of objects in the set <br/>
r = number of objects chosen from the set <br/>

Given a standard deck of 52 cards where we are creating 5 card hands<br/>
n = 52 <br/>
r = 5 <br/>

<br />
<CombinationEquation n={52} r={5} />
<br />
<CombinationSimplifiedStep1 n={52} r={5} />
<br />

Dividing the top and bottom of our fraction by 47! simplifies to: <br/>

<CombinationSimplifiedStep2 n={52} r={5} />
<br />

And then: <br/>

<CombinationSimplifiedStep3 n={52} r={5} />
<br />

And finally: <br/>

<CombinationSimplifiedStep4 n={52} r={5} />
<br />

After solving, we can conclude that there are **2,598,960** unique 5 card poker hands.
